# BookLove

DO you wish you could be in a book club but you don't have time or you don't live near your friends?  Join BookLove!  BookLove is a virtual book club where you and your friends can read and discuss books together.  Take turns being captain and let your friends vote on which book from your Goodreads "To-Read" shelf to read. Discussion entries require a chapter input, so your friend who always gives away spoilers can't ruin the moment for you anymore.  Also, visit your club member's pages to see how far they are in the book, and even get a text when one of your friends has finished!  This is a fresh take on online reading with friends.
